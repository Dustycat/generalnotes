# FX vs VOO

- Overall Summary: 
	- Taxable account (personal brokerage): VOO
	- Retirement account (IRA, 401K): FXAIX
- FXAIX is a MF (Mutual Fund) and VOO is ETF ()
- Mutual Funds tend to be better for tax-advantaged accounts (401k/457b/403b, etc), because when MF's sell to turn over their funds, it can lead to a possible taxable event, which you wouldn't need to worry about in one of these special retirement accounts.
- The big benefits of ETFs include: You can buy/sell at any time while the market is open, vs a MF which you buy once a day when the market closes. I don' t see much of a benefit to being able to buy during the day unless you're trying to optimize the price you want to pay. ETFs are also more tax efficient, and would be a better option if you wanted to put them in a taxable brokerage account.
- For FXAIX vs VOO directly, the biggest difference is the Expense Ratio - how much it costs per year for you to own the fund.
	- FXAIX = 0.015%. This means that for every $10,000 worth of value you hold in the account, it costs you $1.50 per year.
	- VOO = 0.030%. For every $10,000, it costs $3.00 per year.
- VOO trades during market hours whereas FXAIX occurs at market close
- VOO and other ETFs are more portable although within a IRA FXAIX could be sold and the money then invested in VOO before transferring out.

# Non-Retirement Brokerage

Taxable

In general, you want to prefer ETFs over mutual funds in a taxable account, due to the higher tax drag of mutual funds. ETFs are guaranteed to be able to be transferred "in kind" in the future if you ever need or want to switch broke

The main part of my portfolio is FXAIX for large cap, FMCSX for mid cap (higher expense ratio on this one, but also way better returns than FSMDX), FSSSNX for small cap, and FSPSX for International.

## Bonds

Recommended Bond Types

The best bond type depends on your specific financial situation, including your tax bracket and time horizon. 

- **U.S. Treasuries:** Interest is exempt from state and local taxes, making them a good fit for taxable brokerage accounts. They are considered very low-risk and excellent for diversifying against stock market volatility.
- **Municipal Bonds (Munis):** Interest is generally exempt from federal income tax, and often from state and local taxes if you live in the issuing state. These are highly recommended for investors in high tax brackets.
- **Investment-Grade Corporate Bonds:** These offer slightly higher yields than U.S. Treasuries but come with a bit more credit risk.
- **Core Bond Funds/ETFs:** These provide broad exposure to the entire U.S. bond market (including government, corporate, and mortgage-backed securities) and are a simple, diversified approach for most investors.

### Investment Methods: Funds vs. Individual Bonds 

You can invest using bond funds (ETFs or mutual funds) or by buying individual bonds. 

- **Bond Funds (ETFs/Mutual Funds):** Offer instant diversification and are professionally managed with high liquidity.
    - **Examples:**
        - **Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND)** or **Schwab US Aggregate Bond ETF (SCHZ)**: These track the broader bond market and are known for their low expense ratios.
        - **Vanguard Short-Term Treasury ETF (VGSH)**: Focuses on less interest rate risk.
        - **Vanguard Tax-Exempt Bond ETF (VTEB):** A municipal bond option for tax efficiency.
