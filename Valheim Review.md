Here's my feedback on Valheim.

**Combat – 8/10**  
I really enjoy the combat mechanics. There's a bit of skill involved, especially with timing dodges and attacks. I like the cooldown mechanics in both _World of Warcraft_ and various action RPGs like Albion or Diablo.

**Multiplayer – 10/10**  
The ability to play with up to 5+ people is really nice. It's like having our own private MMO server.

**Story and Dungeons – 2/10**  
Echoing MJ's thoughts, this is one of the weakest parts of the game. The procedurally generated dungeons often feel random and disconnected, and the story doesn't do much to enhance the experience. In this regard, I much prefer _Return to Moria_, which offers a more cohesive narrative and dungeon design.

**Skill System – 7/10**  
I like games with skill trees that give players a sense of individuality in group play. _Albion Online_ and most MMOs do this well. Valheim’s skill system is fairly basic by comparison, but still better than many other survival games, which often lack skill progression entirely.

**Base Building – 5/10**  
I usually enjoy base building, but I couldn't get into it with Valheim. Part of it is my own difficulty with 3D construction, but more importantly, the fact that rock walls are clearly superior makes aesthetic building feel pointless. That undermines a big part of the creativity the system could offer.

Fit for Group?
