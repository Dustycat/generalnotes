# Recommendation

1. Strategic Command series (Matrix Games) is a good place to start. World at War, War in the Pacific, WW II in Europe, World War I, and American Civil War
	1. War in the Pacific is in gog a lot
	2. World at War is $40 on steam, but about $10 on ggdeals
2. Shadow Empire - Futuristic
3. Age of Wonders 4
4. Decisive Campaigns (Matrix Games). Barbarossa is a good starter. Ardennes should be fun
5. Flashpoint Campaigns Cold War
6. War in the East 2 (Gary Grisby) - Ultimate goal is to play this game since it's the mother of wargames. However, it's too complex as a starting point
7. Panzer-General suite of games
8. Order of Battle (Slitherine) - Possibly free for base game and expansions are $15 each. Can play Rising Sun? Operational level game

Realtime games
1) Steel Division 2 (large scale war)
2) Steel Division Normandy
3) Combat Missions - Smaller size (company level?)
4) Wargame Red Dragon
5) Warno
