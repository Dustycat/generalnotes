* Great Wall of China - Go really early (630am? before the tour bus)
	* **Mutianyu** is generally the top recommendation for a balance of stunning, restored views, fewer crowds than Badaling, and fun activities like a toboggan ride. 1.5 to 2 hrs from Beijing. Go to the west side. Cable car.
	* Badaling (八达岭) is most accessible by train/bus, fully restored, and close to the city. Extremely crowded, especially on weekends and holidays; often recommended to avoid. Quick, easy trips if you do not mind crowds.
