# Beijing

* Tiananmen Square + Forbidden City + Jingshan park
* National Museum of China
* Temple of Heaven
* Great Wall of China - Go really early (630am? before the tour bus)
	* Mutianyu is generally the top recommendation for a balance of stunning, restored views, fewer crowds than Badaling, and fun activities like a toboggan ride. 1.5 to 2 hrs from Beijing
	* **[Jinshanling](https://www.google.com/search?q=Jinshanling&rlz=1C1UEAD_enUS1076US1076&oq=which+great+wall+&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBwgAEAAYgAQyBwgAEAAYgAQyCggBEEUYFhgeGDkyDQgCEAAYkQIYgAQYigUyBwgDEAAYgAQyCAgEEAAYFhgeMggIBRAAGBYYHjIICAYQABgWGB4yCAgHEAAYFhgeMggICBAAGBYYHjIICAkQABgWGB7SAQgzNjE2ajBqOagCALACAfEFcRkyuFXzonU&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&ved=2ahUKEwisjOjG8aeSAxW-FDQIHVJmH-QQgK4QegQIARAD)** is best for photographers and hikers seeking scenic, partially restored, and quieter, "wilder" sections. 2 to 3 hrs from Beijing
	* Badaling (八达岭) is most accessible by train/bus, fully restored, and close to the city. Extremely crowded, especially on weekends and holidays; often recommended to avoid. Quick, easy trips if you do not mind crowds.
